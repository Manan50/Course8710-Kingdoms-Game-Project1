**Kingdoms**
is an engaging, browser-based game that simulates a strategic conquest where players compete to capture kingdoms on a grid. This game combines elements of strategy, randomness, and real-time decision-making through strategic guessing and is perfect for group play, especially in remote setups.
Game Setup and Initialization
Setting up the game is straightforward. Here is what you need to do:
1.	Start the Game: Initiate the game setup. The moderator is prompted to enter the number of real kingdoms and fake kingdoms.
2.	Enter Names: The moderator is asked to turn off screen sharing and input player names alongside their corresponding kingdom names, which are sent privately to the moderator by the players.
3.	Game Interface: After setup, the game displays a conquest map with a grid overlay. Player names are listed on one side, and kingdom selection buttons are on the other.
4.	Assign Colors and Time Limit: Players are randomly assigned colors, reflected in the grid. Each player has a set time within which they must make their move, or they forfeit their turn.
5.	Conquest Mechanics: Players capture kingdoms during their turn. Capturing a real kingdom leads to domination and termination of other players while selecting a fake one simply ends the turn. The grid colors are then updated to reflect the current state of control.
6.	End Game: The game concludes when one player conquers all other kingdoms, and the grid overlay will reflect that by showing their color over the whole map, emerging as the last king.
Game Rules and Mechanics
•	Game Start: Gameplay starts with the first player's turn.
•	Round Mechanics: Each round is 15 seconds. In their turn, players instruct the moderator which kingdom to capture. Capturing a real kingdom transfers its control, selecting a fake kingdom or their own ends their turn.
•	Turn Sequence: Players take turns in sequence. The active player is highlighted.
•	Victory Condition: A player wins by capturing all kingdoms. A victory message celebrates their success!
•	Player Removal: Players are out if their main kingdom is captured.
•	Disqualification: A player is disqualified if they tell the moderator to select their own kingdom which ruins the game for everyone.
User Interface (UI)
•	Player Section: Shows player names with their assigned colors.
•	Kingdoms Section: Features buttons for each kingdom. The moderator uses these for selections based on players’ choices.
•	Grid Overlay: Visually displays kingdom control through color-coded cells.
•	Round Indicator: Shows the current round and the countdown for the active player’s turn.
Future Work
•	Implement a function to automatically disable screen sharing during sensitive stages of setup.
•	Redesign the grid overlay to mimic real map designs.
•	Explore features for enhanced player engagement and strategic complexity.
•	Overall, we aim to improve the UI of this game to increase player engagement and add more fun elements to the game.
