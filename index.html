        <h3>Read before proceeding:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
          Initiate the game setup. The moderator is prompted to enter the number of real kingdoms and fake kingdoms.
        </li>
        <li>
          The moderator is asked to turn off screen sharing and input player names alongside their corresponding kingdom names, which are sent privately to the moderator by the players.
        </li>
        <li>
          After setup, the game displays a conquest map with a grid overlay. Player names are listed on one side, and kingdom selection buttons are on the other.
        </li>
        <li>
          Players are randomly assigned colors, reflected in the grid. Each player has a set time within which they must make their move, or they forfeit their turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          Players capture kingdoms during their turn. Capturing a real kingdom leads to domination and termination of other players while selecting a fake one simply ends the turn. The grid colors are then updated to reflect the current state of control.
        </li>
        <li>
          The game concludes when one player conquers all other kingdoms, and the grid overlay will reflect that by showing their color over the whole map, emerging as the last king.
        </li>
        </ul>
